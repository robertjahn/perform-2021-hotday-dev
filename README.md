# Dynatrace Perform 2021 Virtual Hands on Training Day
Welcome to the Dynatrace Perform 2021 Virtual HOT Day. Great you join us for a week of hands on learning!

This repo contains supporting material for some of the classes. 
After HOTDAY, attendees will receive a follow up email with links to all relevant training material that was used in the classes

Enjoy the conference and dont forget to give us feedback!

**For instructors**
This repository is currently private but we will make it public during HOT Week.
Please create a directory with the name of your session. Then put all your supporting files, e.g: codelab markdowns, config files, ... -> whatever you need in your class for supporting files into that directory. Feel free to create your own branch first or keep it in the "main" branch.
Cody will create a template directory that includes some codelab markdown examples. He will also be able to import your markdowns from this repo into his codelab environment on Dynatrace University.
If you have any further questions don't hesitate to post them on our #team-perform-vegas-hd slack channel
